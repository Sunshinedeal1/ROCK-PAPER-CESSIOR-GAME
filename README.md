It seems like there might be a slight typo in your question, as the typical game you're referring to is "Rock, Paper, Scissors," not "Rock, Paper, Cessior." Assuming you are asking about "Rock, Paper, Scissors," here's a description of the game techniques:

"Rock, Paper, Scissors" is a simple hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand:

[👊 (Rock) crushes ✌️ (Scissors)
✌️ (Scissors) cuts 🤚 (Paper)
🤚 (Paper) covers 👊 (Rock)]

Rock: A fist.
Paper: An open hand.
Scissors: A fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V.
The game has three possible outcomes, each defeating one of the other shapes:

Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins against Scissors).
Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins against Paper).
Paper covers Rock (Paper wins against Rock).
The game is often used as a decision-making tool or a simple game of chance. The key is that each shape defeats one of the others while being defeated by the remaining one. The outcome is determined by the simultaneous choices made by the players. If both players choose the same shape, it's a tie, and the game can be repeated.

Some variations of the game include additional shapes or gestures, making it more complex or adding a strategic element. However, the basic principles of defeating one shape while being defeated by another remain the same.
